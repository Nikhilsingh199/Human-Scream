# Human-Scream-Detection 
Increase in crime rate is resulting in people living in fear . We should keep in check the situation and try to normalise the crimes happening around the world .
Here , I have tried to implement Machine Learning  and Deep Learning models which will take wav(audio) file as input and Predict wheter is it a human scream or not .
Later , it will display an alert message as low risk , medium risk or high risk.
I havae used the data sets from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whats2000/human-screaming-detection-dataset
and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanzidaakterarusha/scream-dataset.
Model Used :
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine , K nearest Neighbour and Multilayer Perceptron model.
